    description: A self-contained unit comprising the MicroCAT temperature, conductivity and pressure sensors and a pump that is designed specifically for deployment on profiling floats, particularly Argo. The unit is designed to provide stable salinity data accurate to 0.005 PSU for periods in excess of three years without any form of maintenance. Temperature is within 0.002 C (stability 0.0002 C/year) and pressure within 2 dbar (stability 0.8 dbar/year). During float ascent samples are collected at 1 Hz and logged to internal storage to provide a continuous profile passed to the float controller at the surface.
