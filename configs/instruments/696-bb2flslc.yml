    description: A variant of the ECO Puck Triplet (http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current/TOOL0673/). It is a three-optical-sensor, user-defined instrument that carries a fluorometer and 2 scattering meters. ECO Pucks are real‚Äêtime only sensors as they are integrated onto the OEM platform that provides power and data handling. The SLC designation signifies this is a third generation model that is specific for integration into Slocum gliders with a dry science bay. The fluorometer and scattering meters are single wavelength sensors. The model is fitted with an added copper faceplate for bio-fouling mitigation and is depth-rated to 1000 m.
