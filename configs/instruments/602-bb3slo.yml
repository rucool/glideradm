    description: A variant of the ECO Puck Triplet (http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current/TOOL0673/). It is a three-optical-sensor, user-defined instrument that carries 3 scattering meters. ECO Pucks are real‚Äêtime only sensors as they are integrated onto the OEM platform that provides power and data handling. The SLO designation signifies this is a 1st generation model that is specific for integration into Slocum gliders. The fluorometers and scattering meter are single wavelength sensors. The model is depth-rated to 600 m.
