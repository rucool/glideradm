    description: A self-contained device designed to measure turbulence microstructure using 2x SPM-6000 turbulence shear probes, 2x FP07-1000 fast thermistors, 1x SBE7-6000 conductivity sensor, 1x pressure sensor, 2x accelerometers and 1x tilt sensor. Integrates with a variety of marine instrument carriers, such as Gliders, AUVs, moorings, CTD rosettes or profiling floats. It is pressure rated up to 1000 dbar or 6000 dbar. Accuracy is +/-5% velocity shear.
