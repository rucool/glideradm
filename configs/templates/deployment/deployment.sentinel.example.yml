# guidelines for deployment configuration
# 1. All attributes under global_attributes: will override the corresponding attribute in the
#   global_attributes.yml file. Recommend changing all global attributes in this file, not in
#   global_attributes.yml.
# 2. global_attributes:cdm_data_type is either Trajectory or Profile
# 2. String values do not need to be enclosed in single quotes
# 3. Dates should not be single quoted in order to be parsed by pyyaml
# 4. The following should ALWAYS be single quoted:
#   gts_ingest
#   wmo_id
#   wmo_platform_code
#   serial_number
#   os_version
# 5. For attributes that are empty (i.e.: do not have a value), use an empty single quoted string = ''

  summary: The inaugural Sentinel mission, led jointly by Rutgers University and Teledyne Webb Research, will launch the first attempt by an autonomous underwater vehicle to circumnavigate the globe. Beginning with deployment from Cape Cod, the glider Redwing will transit south through the Atlantic to Gran Canaria and South Africa, continue eastward across the Indian Ocean to Australia and New Zealand, cross the Pacific, round Cape Horn, and return northward to its starting point—a route of more than 55,000 km expected to take several years with scheduled stops for battery replacement and maintenance. Navigation will be guided by Rutgers’ Glider Guidance System, which integrates real-time ocean forecast models to optimize routing and energy use. The mission is designed to (1) demonstrate the technical feasibility of basin-to-global scale endurance glider operations, (2) advance ocean and climate science through persistent, multi-sensor observations, and (3) engage students worldwide in hands-on ocean exploration, aligning with the UN Decade of Ocean Science by promoting open data, international collaboration, and inclusive participation in large-scale observing efforts.

  description: An ultra-long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) based on buoyancy. The Sentinel utilises the same features as the G3 glider. The Sentinel is used for remote water column sampling. It uses hydraulic buoyancy change to alter the vehicle density in relation to the surrounding water thereby causing the vehicle to either float or sink. Given an appropriate dive or climb angle, the wings and body lift and convert some of this vertical motion into a forward saw tooth horizontal motion. Periodically, the glider surfaces and calls via Iridium Satellite Phone (anywhere in world) or Free Wave RF Modem (line of sight) in to Dockserver (auto attendant computer) to relay navigational fix, data and receive further instructions for command and control. The glider is capable of storm sampling and can be flown in a coordinated fleet. It is 2.57 m in length, has a hull diameter of 33 cm and mass of approximately 170 kgs (dependent upon configuration). It has an exchangeable payload (capacity up to 8 sensors, 3.5 kg) which is capable of housing a variety of environmental sensors such as nitrate and oxygen. It uses lithium batteries. It is designed for deployments longer than a year (dependent upon configuration), with an operating depth range of 4-1000m. Navigation is via GPS waypoints, a pressure and altimeter sensor. Maximum speed is 0.35 m/s (0.68 knot) with the buoyancy engine and an average up to 0.5 m/s (1 knots) with full drive. The thruster provides speeds up to 1 m/s (2 knots). It transmits via RF modem, Iridium (RUDICS), ARGOS or acoustic modem.
